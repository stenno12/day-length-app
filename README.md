# DayLengthApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.7.

## Stackblitz
You can run the app without downloading by opening https://stackblitz.com/github/stenno12/day-length-app. Be sure to open app in new window because it is not optimized for a small screen

## Development server
If you want to run the app on you computer follow these steps:

1. Install node if you don't have it https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Angular CLI if you don't have it, run: `npm install -g @angular/cli` -g installs it globally
3. Navigate to app directory and run `npm install` to install node packages
4. Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server, -o opens the browser on `http://localhost:4200/`
